# Privacy Policy

**Last updated:** November 27, 2025

## Introduction

This Privacy Policy describes how **IITJ Menu** ("we", "our", or "us") collects, uses, and discloses your information. This app is developed by **Om Tathed** for the IIT Jodhpur community.

## Information Collection and Use

**We do not collect any personal data.**

The IITJ Menu app is designed to display the mess menu for students and faculty. It fetches menu data from a remote configuration but does not require you to create an account, log in, or provide any personal information (such as name, email, phone number, or location).

## Third-Party Services

The app uses the following third-party services to function:

*   **Firebase Remote Config:** Used to fetch the latest menu data.
*   **Firebase Analytics:** Used to collect anonymous usage data (e.g., screen views, button clicks) to help us improve the app. This data is aggregated and does not identify individual users.
*   **Firebase Crashlytics:** Used to report app crashes so we can fix bugs.

These services may collect information used to identify your device for diagnostic purposes, but this is not linked to your personal identity by us.

## Data Security

Since we do not collect personal data, there is no risk of your personal data being breached from our servers.

## Changes to This Privacy Policy

We may update our Privacy Policy from time to time. Thus, you are advised to review this page periodically for any changes. We will notify you of any changes by posting the new Privacy Policy on this page.

If you have any questions or suggestions about our Privacy Policy, do not hesitate to contact us.
